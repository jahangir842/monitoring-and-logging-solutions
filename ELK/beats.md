### **Architecture of Beats**
1. **Input**:
   - Beats collect data from specified sources such as log files, metrics APIs, or network traffic.
2. **Processing**:
   - Minimal data processing occurs locally, such as filtering or enrichment (e.g., adding metadata).
3. **Output**:
   - Data is sent to Elasticsearch or Logstash. Additional output options include Kafka, Redis, and files.

---

### **How Beats Work**
1. **Install and Configure**:
   - Deploy the appropriate Beat on the data source system.
2. **Define Inputs**:
   - Specify the data source (e.g., log files for Filebeat or metrics for Metricbeat).
3. **Processing**:
   - Apply optional filters and enrichments using processors.
4. **Ship Data**:
   - Forward the collected data to Elasticsearch, Logstash, or other endpoints.
5. **Visualize and Analyze**:
   - Use Kibana to analyze and visualize the data.
